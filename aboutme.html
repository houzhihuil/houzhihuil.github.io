        My name is Philip Hou, and I have over 10 years of experience in accounting, particularly in international business trade, real estate property management and manufaturing industry. I've worked with companies like Regent Textile Machinerie, PallayPack Inc, and I have developed a strong expertise in financial analysis, tax compliance, and bookkeeping. I am proficient in various accounting software such as QuickBooks, Sage 50, and Ceridian(Dayforce), as well as ERP systems like Microsoft Dynamics and Momentis Fashion System. I also have experience automating workflows using tools like Power Automate and Google Apps Script.

        Recently, I completed an AEC in Web Programming, which has strengthened my skills in data analysis and automation. I am passionate about finding efficient solutions and integrating AI into accounting processes to streamline tasks. I'm dynamic, motivated, and always looking for ways to bring value to the company I work for.
